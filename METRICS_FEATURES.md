# Enhanced Video Analysis with Metrics and Reporting

## New Features Added

### 1. Advanced Metrics for Yolo9.pt Model

When using the Yolo9.pt model, the system now provides detailed metrics calculations including:

- **Bridge Length Measurement**: Automatically calculates bridge lengths in meters
- **Distance from Riverbank**: Measures distance of objects from river banks
- **Area Calculations**: Computes area in square meters for drainage, vegetation, etc.
- **Object Counting**: Tracks buildings, bridges, drainage systems, potholes, etc.
- **Frame-by-frame Analysis**: Shows metrics for each frame with timestamp

### 2. Enhanced Video Visualization

Videos processed with Yolo9.pt model now display:
- Frame numbers and timestamps
- Real-time metrics overlay
- Distance measurements with visual lines
- Object counts summary at bottom
- Colored masks for different object types
- Bridge length annotations
- Area measurements for relevant objects

### 3. Report Generation

#### CSV Reports
- Complete frame-by-frame detection data
- Object measurements and locations
- Summary statistics
- GPS coordinates (when SRT file provided)
- Export format compatible with Excel

#### PDF Reports
- Professional formatted reports
- Summary statistics table
- Location data with coordinates
- Sample detailed metrics
- Visual charts and graphs

### 4. New API Endpoints

#### `/video/models` - Get Available Models
Returns list of available models with their capabilities:
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "filename": "Yolo9.pt",
      "name": "Yolo9",
      "supports_metrics": true,
      "description": "Advanced metrics model"
    },
    {
      "filename": "best.pt",
      "name": "best",
      "supports_metrics": false,
      "description": "Standard detection model"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `/video/reports/{filename}` - Download Reports
Serves generated CSV/PDF reports for download.

### 5. Enhanced Database Schema

New columns added to videos table:
- `model_used`: Tracks which model was used for processing
- `has_metrics`: Boolean indicating if detailed metrics are available

### 6. Class Detection and Metrics

The Yolo9.pt model detects and measures:

| Class | Metrics Calculated |
|-------|-------------------|
| Buildings | Count, Area, Distance from river |
| Bridges | Count, Length, Distance from river |
| Natural Drainage | Count, Area, Distance from river |
| Manmade Drainage | Count, Area, Distance from river |
| Vegetation in River | Area |
| Silts | Area |
| Potholes | Count, Distance from river |
| Obstacles | Detection and tracking |
| Garbage | Detection and tracking |
| Rocks | Detection and tracking |
| River | Used for distance calculations |

### 7. Configuration Options

- **Ground Sample Distance (GSD)**: Configurable for accurate measurements
- **Drone Speed**: Used for distance from start calculations
- **Buffer Distance**: Configurable buffer zone around rivers (default 30m)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Detection confidence settings

### 8. Report Content

#### CSV Report Columns:
- id, class, frame, time_s, mask_area_m2
- bridge_length_m, dist_from_riverbank_m, dist_from_starting
- confidence, summary counts for each class type
- latitude, longitude (from SRT data)

#### PDF Report Sections:
1. **Summary Statistics**: Total counts for each object type
2. **Location Data**: GPS coordinates with timestamps
3. **Detailed Metrics**: Sample frame-by-frame data
4. **Visual Elements**: Professional formatting with tables

### 9. Usage Instructions

1. **Upload Video**: Select video file for processing
2. **Choose Model**: Select "Yolo9.pt" for detailed metrics
3. **Optional SRT**: Upload SRT file for GPS coordinates
4. **Process**: Wait for processing to complete
5. **Download Reports**: Access CSV/PDF reports from history
6. **View Enhanced Video**: Watch processed video with overlays
