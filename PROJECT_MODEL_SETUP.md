# Project-Based Model Integration Instructions

## Current Setup

You now have a **project-based model selection system** where users choose their project type and the appropriate AI model is automatically selected.

### Available Project Types:

1. **National Highway Analysis** 
   - File: `national_highway_best.pt`
   - For: Road condition analysis, crack detection, highway infrastructure
   - Replace with: Your highway/road detection model

2. **River & Water Body Monitoring**
   - File: `river_monitoring_best.pt` 
   - For: River detection, water quality, garbage in water
   - Replace with: Your river/environmental detection model

3. **Urban Infrastructure Analysis**
   - File: `urban_infrastructure_best.pt`
   - For: Building inspection, urban planning
   - Replace with: Your urban analysis model (or keep as copy of general model)

4. **Forest & Environmental Survey**
   - File: `forest_survey_best.pt`
   - For: Forest monitoring, tree counting, environmental assessment
   - Replace with: Your forest/environmental model (or keep as copy)

5. **Construction Site Monitoring**
   - File: `construction_site_best.pt`
   - For: Construction progress, safety monitoring, equipment detection
   - Replace with: Your construction site model (or keep as copy)

## How to Add Your Actual Models

### Step 1: Replace Model Files
```bash
# Navigate to models directory
cd d:\ModelWebsite\backend\models\

# Replace with your actual trained models
copy "C:\path\to\your\highway_model.pt" "national_highway_best.pt"
copy "C:\path\to\your\river_model.pt" "river_monitoring_best.pt"
# Keep others as copies of your general model for now
```

### Step 2: Test the System
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/upload
2. You'll see project cards instead of a dropdown
3. Click on "National Highway Analysis" or "River & Water Body Monitoring"
4. Upload your video and process

### Step 3: Add More Project Types (Optional)

To add new project types, edit `backend/seed_models.py`:

```python
{
    "name": "Your New Project Name",
    "description": "Description of what this project does",
    "category": "YourCategory",
    "project_type": "your_project_key", 
    "detection_classes": "Class1, Class2, Class3",
    "model_file": "your_new_project_best.pt",
    "created_by": "system"
}
```

Then run: `python seed_models.py`

## Current File Structure
```
backend/models/
├── best.pt                           # Original general model
├── national_highway_best.pt          # Copy (replace with your highway model)
├── river_monitoring_best.pt          # Copy (replace with your river model)  
├── urban_infrastructure_best.pt      # Copy (keep or replace)
├── forest_survey_best.pt             # Copy (keep or replace)
└── construction_site_best.pt         # Copy (keep or replace)
```

## User Experience
- Users see project cards with icons and descriptions
- They click the project type that matches their video content
- The system automatically uses the appropriate AI model
- No technical model selection required from users

## Next Steps
1. Replace `national_highway_best.pt` with your actual highway detection model
2. Replace `river_monitoring_best.pt` with your actual river detection model
3. Test both project types with sample videos
4. Add more project types as needed for your use cases

The system is now **fully functional** with your project-based approach!
